                <p class="p"> Half of all land must be kept in a natural state to protect Earth. World leaders must
                    increase their commitments to conserving land and water, and quickly, if a stable climate and high
                    quality of life are to be preserved in the near future, a new scientific study argues.</p>

                <p class="p">An Ebola epidemic thundering through heavily populated provinces in the northeastern
                    Democratic Republic of the Congo has sickened more than 110 people in the past week—despite the
                    efforts of specialist medical teams, an effective vaccine, and new treatments that are being tested
                    in the region.</p>

                <p class="p">Egypt, land of the pyramids, is the setting for many of the best known tales from the Old
                    Testament. Through Moses, God punishes the Egyptian pharaoh for holding the Hebrew people in
                    bondage. Betrayed by his brothers, young Joseph suffers in slavery in Egypt before rising to become
                    vizier, second in power only to Pharaoh.</p>

                <p class="p">Samaritans are one of the world’s smallest religious groups, claiming descent from three of
                    the 12 tribes of ancient Israel. They consider themselves the true observants of Israelite religion,
                    and view Judaism as a religious practice corrupted during the Babylonian exile.</p>

                    relative of hibiscus last seen in 2009 and believed to be extinct, was still growing on the
                    cliffside.</p>
